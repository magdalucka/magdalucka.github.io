By combining the Offset-Tracking (OT) and DInSAR technique, with high-resolution SAR images, it will analyze changes in glacier kinematics, detect anomalies, and assess speed trends in Greenland and Svalbard. The research involves testing machine learning algorithms to optimize displacement assessment, followed by comparative analyses using GIS software.","date":"2021-07-13T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blist.vercel.app/en/menu/preludium/","tags":["shortcodes","privacy"],"title":"PRELUDIUM 21"}]
